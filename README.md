## Features

- Option to download the PDF after submission.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/quotation-template.git
   cd ramchandra-carpentry-quotation
Create and Activate Virtual Environment: It's a good practice to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. Run the following commands:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # On macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate       # On Windows
Install Dependencies: Install the required dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Install wkhtmltopdf: The application uses pdfkit for generating PDFs, which requires wkhtmltopdf.

On macOS, install via Homebrew:

bash
Copy code
brew install --cask wkhtmltopdf
On Ubuntu/Debian:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get install -y wkhtmltopdf
On Windows:

Download wkhtmltopdf from here.
Install the executable and add the wkhtmltopdf binary to your system's PATH environment variable.
Set the Path for wkhtmltopdf (if necessary): If wkhtmltopdf is not in your PATH, you need to set it manually in the app.py file:

python
Copy code
import pdfkit
path_to_wkhtmltopdf = r'path\to\wkhtmltopdf.exe'  # Windows example
pdfkit.configuration(wkhtmltopdf=path_to_wkhtmltopdf)
Run the Application: After completing the setup, you can run the application locally with:
